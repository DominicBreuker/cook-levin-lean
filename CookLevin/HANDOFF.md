# Handoff — the computable layer / compiler (Risk C2)

Authoritative status & the full risk register live in [`../README.md`](../README.md)
and [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). **This file is the working plan for the compiler
(Risk C2)** — the one obligation the whole NP-completeness bridge sits on.

---

## The bigger picture (read once)

We are proving `theorem CookLevin : NPcomplete SAT`, real and unconditional.
NP-hardness is transported along a chain of poly-time reductions whose **tail**
(`FlatTCC → … → SAT`) is real, done mathematics. The remaining work routes through
one device: **the computable layer** — a tiny structured while-language (`Cmd`/`Op`
with explicit **cost** semantics) compiled **once** to a single-tape `FlatTM`
(`Compile`). Every verifier and reduction is then a short DSL program.

This is **Risk C2**. The framework bridge (`toFrameworkWitness'`, `inNPLang_to_inNP`)
and the live `sat_NP : inNP SAT` all reduce to one obligation:
**`Compile_sound` / `Compile_run_physical_residue`** (still `sorry`). Discharging it
is the job.

---

## ⚠ The invariant: `BitState`

The compiled machine has a **fixed 4-symbol alphabet** (`sig = 4`). `encodeTape`
shifts each register cell `+1` (`0→1`, `1→2`), `0` separates registers, `3`
terminates. A cell `≥ 2` shifts to `≥ 3` and collides with the terminator, so
**every state touching the tape must be `Compile.BitState`** (all cells `∈ {0,1}`).
Numbers are therefore **UNARY** (`enc n = replicate n 1`). This is sound for the size
law because `encodable.size Nat = id` (verified): unary length `= n = size n`, so
`enc_size : len ≤ 2·size+1` holds. (No log-vs-unary blowup — the whole framework is
already unary-flavoured.) `sig=4`/`BitState` is **owner-settled** (2026-06-03;
the `sig=6` block-copy alternative was dropped). It is therefore **locked**: every
encoding that ever reaches `Compile` must be bit-level. This is the premise the
design decision below rests on.

### ★ DESIGN DECISION — SETTLED (reviewed 2026-06-05): adopt **Option B′**

The three top-level obligations — `Compile_sound` (Compile.lean:6200),
`Compile_run_physical` (6360), `Compile_run_physical_residue` (6390) — are stated
**without** a `BitState s` hypothesis, but every per-op/per-fragment lemma needs it
(`compileOp_sound_physical_residue`:5717 + the per-op `BitState` lemmas at
2393/2554/2901/3025/3160/3387/3535/3761/3823/4149). Adding `hbit` (Task 1) forces
each compile site to supply `BitState` of the state it feeds in. The previous
handoff posed this as a fork (A: bundle `enc_bit` into `LangEncodable`, breaking
`List Nat = id`; B: a localized `BitEncodable` keeping the generic toolkit
untouched) and recommended **B**. **This review validated B's *mechanism* but found
its *justification* is a misconception that would waste effort if followed
literally.** Two machine-checked findings:

1. **The bit-level work is systemic, not localizable.** `BitState` is mandatory for
   *every* state reaching `Compile`, and in the endgame (S3 migration) *every* chain
   type is compiled — so every canonical encoding (`Nat`, `X×Y`, `List X`) must
   become bit-level eventually. The value-as-length ops that build/read the product
   length-prefix — `consLen` (writes `(s.get lenSrc).length`, Semantics.lean:60),
   `takeAt`/`dropAt` (read `(s.get lenReg).headD 0`, :53–56) — and the entire
   `swap`/`mapFst`/`mapSnd` product toolkit built on them (PolyTime.lean:1643) are
   **fundamentally non-`BitState`** and must be rebuilt unary **regardless of fork**.
   So B's headline selling point — "keeps `List Nat = id` and the generic toolkit
   untouched" — is **false**. `List Nat = id` (arbitrary Nat cells) and `Nat = [n]`
   have **no compiled future** under `sig=4`; they are vestiges, not assets to
   protect.
2. **The live `sat_NP` path does not use `LangEncodable` at all.** `sat_NP →
   inTimePolyTM_evalCnf → inTimePolyLang_to_inTimePoly → DecidesLang.toDecidesBy`
   (PolyTime.lean:117, **still `sorry`**) runs the **free-encoding** `DecidesLang`
   with the bespoke 12-register `EvalCnfCmd.encodeState` (EvalCnfCmd.lean:87) — whose
   cells are `v+3` (variable values) and `CLAUSE_END=2`, i.e. **not `BitState` and
   not even `sig=4`-representable**. So "give `cnf × assgn` a bit-level
   `LangEncodable` encoding" does **not** discharge the live obligation; the live
   obligation is `BitState (EvalCnfCmd.encodeState x)`, a property of that
   hand-written encoding, which must itself be re-laid out unary (variables unary, no
   `+3`/`2` literal cells).

**Conclusion: the only genuine, still-open choice is *where the `BitState` guarantee
is attached*, given bit-level encodings are mandatory either way. Attach it on the
witness, supplied by a reusable mixin — call this Option B′:**

- **Do NOT bundle `enc_bit` into `LangEncodable`** (Option A). Keep `LangEncodable`
  the bare encode/decode/size class. Bundling forces a big-bang where every instance
  must be bit-level at once (breaks "green between commits") and still cannot cover
  the free-encoding live path.
- **Add `enc_bit : ∀ x, Compile.BitState (encodeIn x)` as a FIELD on the witness
  structures** `DecidesLang`, `DecidesLang'`, `PolyTimeComputableLang`,
  `PolyTimeComputableLang'`. This is the **load-bearing, universal home**: `encodeIn`
  is a free function there, so it covers both the live free path (`evalCnfCmd`) and
  the canonical path. This is what `Compile_run_physical_residue`'s `hbit` is fed
  from at each bridge.
- **Add a reusable mixin `class BitEncodable (X) [encodable X] [LangEncodable X] :
  Prop where enc_bit : ∀ x, Compile.BitState (LangEncodable.encodeState x)`** so
  canonical witnesses (`DecidesLang'`, `PolyTimeComputableLang'`) discharge their
  field once-per-type instead of per-witness. Prove it for each bit-level canonical
  type as it is migrated — this gives the **incremental** migration B promised, but
  honestly (no false "toolkit untouched" claim).
- **Make the canonical encodings bit-level** (`Nat` unary; `X×Y` unary length-prefix;
  `List X` self-delimiting on bit separators) and give each a `BitEncodable` instance.
  **Retire `List Nat = id` / `Nat = [n]` from the compiled path** (quarantine, don't
  necessarily delete — verify no non-compiled lemma depends on them first; default is
  to replace with the bit versions).

Net: B′ = **B's typeclass shape** (witness-carried obligation + `BitEncodable` mixin,
incremental) **+ A's substance** (bit-level canonical encodings, unary `Nat`, rebuilt
ops/toolkit). It is neither naive-A (big-bang) nor naive-B (the false "localized to
`cnf × assgn`, toolkit untouched" framing). No owner sign-off is required to proceed —
the only premise (`sig=4`) is already owner-settled.

---

## ⚠⚠ Corrected sequencing (this session's headline risk finding)

The previous handoff's order — *"build the transfer gadget → takeAt/dropAt →
copy/tail/concat/eqBit → encodings"* — is **inconsistent with its own findings**.
All 7 remaining ops are gated on **Task 1 (the `BitState` plumbing)**:

- `takeAt`/`dropAt`/`consLen` read a length from a register **cell value**
  (`(s.get lenReg).headD 0`). Under `BitState` that value is `≤ 1`, so the current
  semantics can only take/drop 0 or 1 elements. They are **meaningless until Task 1
  restates the length as a UNARY count** (`= the register's length`). Building them
  first builds semantics Task 1 throws away.
- `copy`/`tail`/`concat`/`eqBit` must **preserve `src`** (`Op.eval` writes only
  `dst`). A mark-free single-tape copy that preserves the source needs a
  **guaranteed-empty scratch register** → an extra `Op` operand → an `Op`-signature
  change that is *"folded into Task 1"*.
- The only current witnesses using these ops (`swapCmd`/`mapFstCmd`/`mapSndCmd`,
  PolyTime.lean ~970/1200) are **built on the current non-unary product encoding**
  (they unpack via the Nat length-prefix). Task 1 rewrites them anyway — so a scratch
  operand added *before* Task 1 would force a `swapCmd` rewrite Task 1 then **rewrites
  again** (double work — exactly what we avoid).

**Correct order:** **Task 1 (coupled batch) FIRST** → then the op gadgets →
Finding A budget → assembly. The *raw-tape transfer gadget* (below) is the **one**
op-related piece that is encoding-agnostic and may be built before/concurrent with
Task 1.

---

## ✅ Probe verdict: the transfer-gadget design is GO (validated this session)

The recommended op realization (deep-pass "Finding B") is a **counter-free two-phase
transfer** that reuses **only already-proven gadgets**. Validated end-to-end by
`#eval` on real `encodeTape`s (probe files were `/tmp/probe*.lean`; reproduce with
`env LEAN_PATH=$(lake env printenv LEAN_PATH) lean <file>`):

**Move-one-bit primitive** (the inner loop body of each phase): from
`encodeTape s ++ res`, do
`navigateAndTestTM src` → (content) `bitReadTM` (reads bit into the state) →
`deleteCarryTM` (delete src's front cell, left-shift, `+1` `0`-residue) → rewind to 0
→ `appendAtTM (bit+1) dst` → rewind to 0. Probed (`src=[[1,0],[1]]`, move reg0's
front bit to reg1): `[3,2,1,0,2,0,3] → [3,1,0,2,2,0,3,0]` =
`encodeTape [[0],[1,1]] ++ [0]` (terminator-free residue). **Works for `dst>src`
AND `dst<src`** (probed both). ⚠ **The append symbol is `bit+1`, not `bit`** (the
encoding shifts `+1`; `appendAtTM (bit+1)` — already the convention used by the proven
append op, Compile.lean:2396). Each phase is a `clear`-style `loopTM` that **terminates
by emptying a register** (the proven termination mode), so `loopTM_run` /
`loopTM_no_early_halt` apply directly.

**Per-op realizations** (all from the move primitive, after Task 1 adds scratch `sc`):
`copy dst src sc` = move `src→sc` (src empties) ⨾ move `sc→src`&`dst` (sc empties,
src rebuilt, dst built, order preserved); `tail` = drop the first transferred bit for
`dst`; `concat` = two copies; `eqBit` = transfer both, AND the front bits;
`takeAt`/`dropAt` bound phase 2 by the unary `lenReg`; `consLen` similar. **No new
low-level TM is needed** — the rotation/`copyBlockTM` sketches from older handoffs are
dropped.

**Probe verdict: GO.** No tape-level snag; the only new requirement is the empty
scratch operand (Task 1). Build the move primitive + its run/`_no_early_halt`/budget
**mirroring the proven `clearRegionTM_run` chain** (it is the same `loopTM` shape with
an extra `appendAtTM` in the body). **Re-probe each assembled machine end-to-end
before proving its run lemma** (architecture bugs are invisible to validity proofs).

---

## The ordered plan from here

The fork is settled (**B′**, above). The raw-tape transfer gadget (below the GO
verdict) is the **one** op-piece buildable before Task 1; everything else waits on
Task 1.

**1. The `BitState` plumbing (one coupled green-landing batch).** This is the old
"Task 2" restated per B′. Land it green in this order:
- **Obligations:** add `(hbit : Compile.BitState s)` to `Compile_sound`,
  `Compile_run_physical`, `Compile_run_physical_residue`.
  - ✅ **2026-06-05 — the induction step is now PROVEN** (`Op.eval_preserves_BitState`,
    Compile.lean, axiom-clean): `BitState s → o.inBounds s → (consLen side-cond) →
    BitState (Op.eval o s)`. Plus the unconditional **`BitState_set_pad`** (drops
    `BitState_set`'s `dst < s.length` requirement, for `forBnd`'s padding
    counter-write). These are the atoms the `Cmd` induction composes — **reuse them
    directly**; do not re-derive per-op `BitState`.
  - ⚠ **Machine-checked refinement of "value-as-length ops are non-`BitState`":**
    only **`consLen`** actually breaks `BitState` (`Op.consLen_breaks_BitState` is an
    explicit counterexample — it writes a length as a `≥2` cell). `takeAt`/`dropAt`
    **preserve** `BitState` (sub-list of a bit register); they are merely *useless*
    under it. So when restating ops below: `consLen` MUST become unary for
    **correctness**; `takeAt`/`dropAt` only for **expressiveness**. Once `consLen` is
    unary the `hcons` side-condition of `Op.eval_preserves_BitState` is discharged
    unconditionally and the lemma becomes the clean universal induction step.
  - ✅ **2026-06-05 — the `inBounds`-threading question is RESOLVED.** The static
    wellformedness predicate already existed (`Cmd.UsesBelow c k`, Frame.lean —
    "touches only registers `< k`"). The missing bridge is now built, sorry-free and
    axiom-clean: `State.set_length_ge`/`Op.eval_length_ge`/`Cmd.eval_length_ge`
    (Frame.lean — register count never shrinks) + **`Op.inBounds_of_UsesBelow`**
    (PolyTime.lean — `UsesBelow o k → k ≤ s.length → o.inBounds s`). So the residue
    induction threads **two invariants**: fix `k ≤ s.length` with `Cmd.UsesBelow c k`;
    `BitState` is re-established per-op by `Op.eval_preserves_BitState`, and `inBounds`
    by `Op.inBounds_of_UsesBelow` (width is monotone, so every reached state keeps
    width `≥ k`). **`Compile_run_physical_residue` will need an added `(hk : Cmd.UsesBelow
    c s.length)` hypothesis** (or `k ≤ s.length` + `UsesBelow c k`) alongside `hbit`;
    the bridge then supplies both from the witness (the encoder fixes `s.length` and the
    program's register footprint).
  - ✅ **2026-06-05 — the `Cmd`-level combination is now PROVEN**
    (`Cmd.eval_preserves_BitState`, PolyTime.lean, axiom-clean): `Cmd.UsesBelow c k →
    k ≤ s.length → Cmd.NoConsLen c → BitState s → BitState (c.eval s)`. The full
    induction (incl. the `forBnd` fold, invariant `k ≤ width ∧ BitState`) **composes** —
    **reuse it** when restating `Compile_run_physical_residue`. `Cmd.NoConsLen` is the
    single temporary hypothesis Task 1 removes (restate `consLen` unary ⇒ it is bit-safe
    ⇒ the predicate is unnecessary). Worth checking: are the live `EvalCnfCmd` / reduction
    `Cmd`s already `consLen`-free? (consLen is used only by the `swap`/`mapFst`/`mapSnd`
    product toolkit, which Task 1 rebuilds anyway.)
- **Witness field:** add `enc_bit : ∀ x, Compile.BitState (encodeIn x)` to
  `DecidesLang`, `DecidesLang'`, `PolyTimeComputableLang`, `PolyTimeComputableLang'`.
  This is what feeds `hbit` at every bridge (`bitDecider_run`,
  `DecidesLang.toDecidesBy`, `toFrameworkWitness'`). **The free-encoding bridges
  (`DecidesLang.toDecidesBy`, `inTimePolyLang_to_inTimePoly`, PolyTime.lean:117/132)
  are still `sorry` — close them now using the new field.**
- **Mixin:** `class BitEncodable (X) [encodable X] [LangEncodable X] : Prop where
  enc_bit : ∀ x, Compile.BitState (LangEncodable.encodeState x)`; use it to supply
  the `enc_bit` field of the canonical witnesses once-per-type.
- **Bit-level canonical encodings:** `Nat` unary (`replicate n 1`); `X×Y` unary
  length-prefix; `List X` self-delimiting on bit separators. Re-prove
  `dec_enc`/`enc_size` (unary roughly doubles size — loosen `enc_size`'s constant if
  needed; ripples to `NP.lean` `DecidesBy.encode_size` + the decider budget, both
  need only `inOPoly`/`monotonic`). Give each a `BitEncodable` instance. Retire
  `List Nat = id` / `Nat = [n]` from the compiled path (quarantine; verify nothing
  non-compiled breaks before deleting).
- **Value-as-length ops → unary:** restate `Op.takeAt`/`dropAt`/`consLen` so length =
  the register's **unary count**, not `(s.get lenReg).headD 0` / not a written
  `.length` cell. Add an empty-scratch operand to `copy`/`tail`/`concat`/`eqBit`
  (`copy dst src sc`, precondition `s.get sc = []`, `sc < length`, `sc ∉ {dst,src}`;
  `Op.eval` ignores `sc`, the gadget restores it to `[]`). Re-derive
  `swapCmd`/`mapFstCmd`/`mapSndCmd` against the new encoding & signatures (witnesses
  already allocate spare scratch registers).
- **The live path — `EvalCnfCmd` (EvalCnfCmd.lean):** re-lay `encodeState` unary so
  it is `BitState` *and* `sig=4`-representable — today its cells are `v+3` (variables,
  unbounded) and `CLAUSE_END=2`. Variables must be **unary blocks**; the polarity /
  clause-end markers must live in `{0,1}` (use a bit-pattern delimiter, not a `2`).
  This also rewrites `memberCheck` (variable equality becomes unary-block equality,
  `eqBit`/transfer-based). Supply its `enc_bit` field. **This — not a `LangEncodable
  (cnf × assgn)` instance — is what discharges `sat_NP`.** (`evalCnfCmd`'s bodies are
  already `sorry`, so no proven work is discarded.)

**2. Build the 7 op gadgets** (`compileOp_sound_physical_residue`, the 7 remaining
`sorry`s at Compile.lean:5763–5779): the move-bit primitive (probe-validated) + the
two-phase transfer loop, wired per op. **Templates:** `clearRegionTM_run` (the
`loopTM` chain to mirror), `opNonEmpty_run` (branch-merge engine + budget),
`opHead_run` (nested branch + `bitReadTM` reuse). Bump the per-op budget when a
chain exceeds the current `9·L²+9·L+30` (3 sites: statement + the two relaxing
`le_trans … (by omega)` in the proven append/clear cases).

**3. Finding A — restate the top-level budget (do this WITH the assembly, not
before).** The stated `overhead(size+cost)` with `overhead m = (m+1)²` is **too small
on two counts**: per-op budgets are `Θ(L²)` (multi-cell ops) so summing `~cost` of
them is **cubic**, and `L = size + s.length + 2` includes the **register count
`s.length`** which `overhead(size+cost)` drops. Restate as
`overhead(State.size s + s.length + c.cost s)` with `overhead` bumped to **cubic**
(e.g. `9·(m+1)³`). Downstream consumers (`bitDecider_run`, `DecidesBy` budgets,
`toFrameworkWitness'.timeBound`) use only `overhead_poly`/`overhead_mono`
(degree-agnostic) → ripples mechanically. Stays poly on the live path (`encodeState x`
is 1 register; the program adds a constant `regBound`).

**4. Assemble** `Compile_run_physical_residue` → `Compile_sound` by induction on
`Cmd`: per-`Op` from step 2, `seq` from `compileSeq_sound_physical_residue` (PROVEN).
⚠ **Gap surfaced 2026-06-05:** the `ifBit`/`forBnd` contracts that currently exist
(`compileIfBit_sound_physical`, `compileForBnd_sound_physical`, Compile.lean
~6045/6096, both `sorry`) are stated with the **exact-tape** contract (`tapes =
encodeTape (evalT s)`), **not** the residue-tolerant one. A loop/branch body can be a
length-decreasing op (`clear`/`tail`/…) whose real physical run leaves
`encodeTape output ++ residue` — so these exact-tape hypotheses are **unsatisfiable
for shrinking bodies** (the same `TapeMono` obstruction that killed
`compileOp_sound_physical`) and cannot be fed by `compileOp_sound_physical_residue`.
**Before assembling, restate both as residue-tolerant siblings** (mirror how
`compileSeq_sound_physical_residue` generalises `compileSeq_sound_physical`: thread
`res_in`/`res_out`, require only the inter-fragment residue `ValidResidue`), then
prove them via `branchComposeFlatTM_run` / `loopTM_run` + `loopTM_no_early_halt`.
⚠ **Also note (prerequisite, not just a restatement):** `compileForBnd`
(Compile.lean:1631) is still a `compiledCmd_default` **stub**, and `compileIfBit`
(1537) is wired to `compileTestBit` which is **also a stub** (`branchTester_default`,
1483) — so neither machine actually branches/loops yet. The real `compileTestBit`
(navigate to register `t`, then `bitReadTM`-style read → `exitPos`/`exitNeg`) and the
real `compileForBnd` (a `loopTM` over `bound`'s unary length, writing the counter)
must be **built** before their contracts can be proven. This is C1/C3 gadget work,
comparable in size to a cross-register op. This discharges C2; downstream unlocks S3
migration, C7 verifiers, C8 hardness, S1 tableau.

✅ **The last mile (residue contract ⇒ `Compile_sound`) is already PROVEN**
(`Compile.sound_of_run_residue`, Compile.lean, axiom-clean): feed it the residue
run's components + `BitState (c.eval s)` (from `Cmd.eval_preserves_BitState`) and it
extends the run to the full budget and decodes (residue invisible). So the only
remaining content for `Compile_sound` is `Compile_run_physical_residue` itself
(induction over the per-`Op`/`ifBit`/`forBnd` contracts above).

## Conventions & hard-won gotchas

- **Build:** `export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"; lake build` (`lake` is **not** on
  PATH; LSP/most MCP features can't find it). First build slow; one module ~10s
  (`lake build Complexity.Lang.Compile` to iterate). Commit per logical step, green.
- **Probe** a built machine end-to-end *before* proving its run lemma:
  `env LEAN_PATH=$(lake env printenv LEAN_PATH) lean /tmp/x.lean` with
  `import Complexity.Lang.Compile`, `open Complexity.Lang`, and
  `runFlatTM N M { state_idx := M.start, tapes := [([], 0, Compile.encodeTape s)] }`.
  Namespaces: `Compile.*`, `ClearGadget.*`, `AppendGadget.*`, `ShiftTape.*`,
  `Compile.bitReadTM`. **Every gadget exits with its head on the trailing terminator**
  — rewind-bracket, don't assume "left of" it.
- **Axiom-check** via a scratch file: `#print axioms <name>` must show only
  `propext`/`Classical.choice`/`Quot.sound` — **no `sorryAx`**.
- **Append a BIT `b`** = `appendAtTM (b+1)` (the encoding shifts `+1`). `deleteCarryTM`
  deletes the cell **left of the head** (head at `pre.length+1` deletes index
  `pre.length`); `navigateAndTestTM src` lands the head **on** src's first content cell.
- **`omega` can't see through `Var := Nat`** (use a `Nat`-typed `bit` param, not `Var`),
  **record projections / `def`-constants** (`show` the reduced form first), nor a
  `set x := e` for hyps created *after* the `set` (`rw [hxdef] at h` first).
- Branching-op correctness for `dst = src`: **read `src` BEFORE clearing/writing `dst`**
  (`Op.inBounds` does NOT force `dst ≠ src`).
- Methodology (do not deviate without reason): **skeleton-first, refine the
  highest-risk gap next, decompose `sorry`s don't elaborate them, probe before
  committing engineering, `def`+`sorry` over `axiom` (count = 0).**
