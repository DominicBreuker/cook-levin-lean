# Cook–Levin in Lean 4

A Lean 4 formalisation targeting the **Cook–Levin theorem** (SAT is
NP-complete), structured as a port of the Coq development by Forster, Kunze,
Roth et al. (<https://github.com/uds-psl/cook-levin>, mirrored under `coqdoc/`).

**Work in progress.** `CookLevin/Complexity/NP/SAT/CookLevin.lean` declares
`theorem CookLevin : NPcomplete SAT` and Lean accepts it, but the term is **not
yet a faithful proof**: the combinatorial heart is rigorous, but the front of
the proof is a *compiling skeleton* (`sorry`s) plus a few `sorry`-free but
*vacuous* reductions. The strategy and the ordered plan to make it
unconditional live in [`CookLevin/ROADMAP.md`](CookLevin/ROADMAP.md) — read it
for direction.

## Status at a glance

- `lake build` ✅ green; **0 project axioms** (only `propext` /
  `Classical.choice` / `Quot.sound`).
- ~11K LOC on the proof path under `CookLevin/` (a further ~14K parked, not
  built).
- ~30 `sorry`s (completion gaps, Risk register Group C); the C5a `map_fst`
  `sorry`s and the **C6 bit-test gadget** (`Compile.bitTestTM`) are now
  **closed** `sorry`-free.
- **≥ 4 `sorry`-free *vacuous* defs** on the proof path — the deepest gaps
  (Risks S1/S2/S3). They do **not** appear in the `sorry` count or under
  `#print axioms`, so the `sorry` count overstates how close the proof is.
- `CookLevin : NPcomplete SAT` typechecks but is **conditional** on all of the
  above. **No unprobed structural unknown remains**: every gap is now bounded
  engineering.
- **Current work — the S3 migration (in progress).** Risk C9 (canonical layer
  encoding) is done, and the layer-side migration engine is built and proved
  in `Lang/PolyTime.lean` (product encoding, `comp`, verifier-composition
  `precompose`/`ofReduction`, and the **layer-native NP class** `inNPLang` with
  its reduction-closure theorem `red_inNPLang` — the layer analogue of
  `red_inNP`), all sorry-free and axiom-clean. The **C5a frame-preservation
  calling convention** is also landed (`Lang/Frame.lean`: `Cmd.UsesBelow` +
  frame/locality lemmas; a `regBound`/`usesBelow` field on
  `PolyTimeComputableLang'`; the `eval_frame`/`eval_get_of_agree` applications) —
  so a witness program can run as a subroutine on register 0 while a stashed
  pair component survives. The contract was also **relaxed to register-wise
  (pointwise) `normalizes`** — the exact-equality form silently forbade scratch
  registers (so it was too weak for *every* real layer program, not just
  `map_fst`); composition was re-validated for scratch-using programs via the
  frame lemmas. The length-as-value `Op`s and the **`map_fst` program** are now
  **complete and `sorry`-free** (all fields, including `normalizes`/`cost_le`,
  proved via the shared `mapFst_pre_eval`/`mapFst_pre_agree` lemmas), and
  `map_fst` is wired into `red_inNPLang` internally (so the closure theorem takes
  no `map_fst` hypothesis). The **framework decider bridge** `inNPLang → inNP` is
  now also **assembled** (`inNPLang_to_inNP`): the **C6** tape→state bit-test
  gadget (`Compile.bitTestTM`, `sorry`-free) turns a canonical `DecidesLang'`
  answer (tape register `0`) into a `DecidesBy` accept/reject *state* via
  `composeFlatTM_run`, and `DecidesBy.encode_size` was relaxed to admit the
  layer's linear encoding. It reduces to a single focused obligation — the
  `Compile` physical run contract (`Compile_run_physical`, Risk C2). Then `⪯p` is
  migrated and the sound tail rippled. See the ROADMAP plan.

## What is sound vs. what is not

The proof follows the standard recipe; NP-hardness is transported from a
universal NP source down to SAT along a chain of `⪯p` reductions:

```
GenNP ⪯p … ⪯p FlatSingleTMGenNP ⪯p FlatTCC ⪯p FlatCC ⪯p BinaryCC ⪯p FSAT ⪯p SAT
└──────────── front: NOT sound ────────────┘└──────────── tail: SOUND ───────────┘
```

**Sound (real mathematics, ~3K LOC, do not touch):** the tail
`FlatTCC → FlatCC → BinaryCC → FSAT → SAT` (window/cover equivalence, unary
block encoding, tableau CNF, a full Tseytin transform), plus `kSAT_to_SAT` and
`kSAT_to_FlatClique`. The `FlatTM` model, the `encodable`/`inOPoly` machinery,
the `DecidesBy`/`inTimePoly` interface, and the `composeFlatTM` combinator
family (~3.5K LOC) are also sound. Cook–Levin *after* a TM run is encoded as a
`FlatTCC` is essentially in place.

**Not sound (the front, `GenNP → FlatTCC`)** — three gaps, all probed:

- **S3** — these reductions typecheck only because `polyTimeComputable` bounds
  *output size*, not runtime. It is the enabling weakness. *Probed feasible but
  expensive:* the honest TM-backed witness `PolyTimeComputableWitness'` and the
  real bridge `toFrameworkWitness'` are built additively in `Lang/PolyTime.lean`
  (sorry-free modulo the assumed `Compile_sound`), and the probe confirms the
  upgrade *forces* S1/S2 to become real. Executing it needs a canonical layer
  encoding (Risk C9) and then ripples to every reduction.
- **S1** — `FlatSingleTMGenNP ⪯p FlatTCC` is `if (source is yes-instance) then
  yesInst else noInst`; its output depends on the *answer*. Deepest gap.
  *Probed feasible but expensive (~6–11K LOC):* real fix = the Cook 2D tableau
  (`Simulators/CookTableau.lean`).
- **S2** — the `LM→mTM→singleTape` bridges use a 1-state `bridgeMachine` that
  discards the source TM. *Probed:* the multi-tape→single-tape simulator
  (`Simulators/MultiToSingle.lean`) is **not needed** — it is a Coq-porting
  artifact (`TM σ n` erases the tape count; the predicates ignore the machine;
  the layer is single-tape-native). Real fix = collapse the phantom bridges and
  bind the predicates to the single-tape layer decider — this folds into the
  universal-source work (C8).

## The strategy: a higher-level computable layer

Building verifiers/reductions directly as `FlatTM`s overran budget ~10× and was
abandoned (parked under `parked/`). The pivot: a small structured while-language
`Cmd`/`Op` with explicit **cost** semantics, compiled **once** to `FlatTM`
(`Compile`). Every downstream verifier/reduction is then a short DSL program.
This is the Lean analogue of the L-calculus the Coq port uses — and, being
single-tape by construction, it is also why the S2 multi-tape detour is
unnecessary.

The layer's three make-or-break structural unknowns are **validated**:
per-primitive compilation (C1), composition (C2, `compileSeq_compose_physical`),
and the counted loop (C3, `loopTM` + `loopTM_run`, sorry-free). The S3
layer→framework bridge is validated too (`toFrameworkWitness'`), and the design
item the S3 probe surfaced — **Risk C9**, a canonical per-type layer encoding
(`LangEncodable` + `PolyTimeComputableLang'`) — is built with its composition
proved. The S3 migration is now **in progress**: the layer-side engine
(product encoding, `comp`, verifier-composition `precompose`/`ofReduction`, and
the layer-native NP closure `inNPLang`/`red_inNPLang`) is done, **C5a**
(`map_fst`, a frame-preserving calling convention) is **complete and
`sorry`-free**, and the **framework decider bridge** `inNPLang → inNP`
(`inNPLang_to_inNP`) is now **assembled** — the C6 tape→state bit-test gadget
(`Compile.bitTestTM`) is built `sorry`-free and composed after `Compile c`,
reducing the bridge to the single `Compile` physical run contract
(`Compile_run_physical`, Risk C2). Next: migrate `⪯p` itself and ripple the
sound tail. See the ROADMAP plan.

## Development methodology: skeleton-first, risk-driven

(do not deviate without reason — full rationale in the ROADMAP)

1. **Skeleton first** — the whole proof path compiles with `sorry`s before any
   single proof is closed.
2. **Refine the highest-risk gap next** (per the Risk register), not in phase
   order.
3. **Decompose `sorry`s, don't elaborate them** — each split is a structural
   decision.
4. **Prefer `def` + `sorry` over `axiom`** (axiom count is a metric to minimise;
   currently 0).
5. **Probe before committing engineering** — for a big unknown, run a time-boxed
   go/no-go probe and give a verdict (feasible / feasible-but-expensive /
   trigger-fallback).
6. **Build green between commits; record gaps in commit messages.**

## Building

`mathlib` is the only dependency. From the repo root:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.elan/bin:$PATH"
lake build
```

First build from a clean checkout is slow (mathlib cache). Lake's `lean_lib`
root is `CookLevin/`, so `parked/` is not built.

## Where to look first

- **The plan:** [`CookLevin/ROADMAP.md`](CookLevin/ROADMAP.md) — *The plan from
  here* (next topic: the S3 migration) and the Risk register.
- **Real mathematics:** `NP/SAT/CookLevin/Subproblems/FlatTCC.lean` and the
  `Reductions/FlatTCC_to_FlatCC.lean → … → BinaryCC_to_FSAT.lean` chain, then
  `NP/FSAT_to_SAT.lean`.
- **The framework:** `Complexity/NP.lean` (`DecidesBy`, `inTimePoly`, `⪯p`) and
  `Complexity/TMPrimitives.lean` (`composeFlatTM`/`loopTM`).
- **The layer:** `Complexity/Lang/` (`Compile.lean`, `PolyTime.lean`).
- **What must be replaced:** the S1/S2/S3 entries in the ROADMAP Risk register.
